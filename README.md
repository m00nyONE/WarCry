# WarCry

This ESO Addon is mainly used by my Raidgroup but can also be interesting for others that want to have some fun with their team

The main purpose is to always be able to playback the WarCry emote. It is the one you get from the open dungeon in wrothgar.
The leader of a group can use a predefined word in the /party chat to trigger the collectible on all group members. And it looks awesome
